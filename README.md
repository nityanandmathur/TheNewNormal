## Problem Statement 1 - Post Covid Solution

Finally the deadly second wave of covid 19 has ended and things are getting back to normal. But we cannot deny the fact that there is no going back to the lifestyle of the Pre-Covid Era. The only thing we can do is to accept this 'New-normal' and find solutions to ease the issues we are facing in this Post-Covid Era. Develop a platform that solves the problem of accumulation of crowd and prevent outbreak of this deadly disease in an innovative manner.

## From Pandemic to Endemic
 
Graph of covid seems to relieve as compared to what damage it has already offered to all of us. 
In other regions, if aided by vaccines, aimed for a similar zero-COVID strategy, then could the world hope to rid itself of the virus?
Many scientists and researchers believe that Covid-19 It’s a beautiful dream but most scientists think it’s improbable.

## List of solutions to the problem statement
1) Overcrowding - As we have seen there's so many mutations happening over time. According to many scientists and researchers our body will take ample amount of time to totally get rid of all these, according to the mutations happening and as each and every persons have different genes we need to stay safe and shouldn't interact with many people. Overcrowding is a serious predicament that should be handeled properly with time. For the very purpose we have created a Tensorflow based Machine Learning model capable of detecting overcrowding and informing the local authorities at the very same time.

2) Individual Focus/health tips  - In the present era of covid, it is important to establish the proper mental and ohysical health. It is extremely important that everybody should be able to diagonse themselves without use of external aid. For the very purpose, we have created a Machine Learning model integrated with Flask to deploy as Web Application. This model would take some geneal parameters from individuals and returns their chances of getting Diabetes or Heart Attack.
